Create a new Github page with a presentation on the concepts of Multivariate Regression Analysis and Gradient Boosting. Include a presentation of Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost).
Apply the regression methods (including lowess and boosted lowess) to real data sets, such as "Cars" and "Boston Housing Data".  Record the cross-validated mean square errors and the mean absolute errors.
For each method and data set report the crossvalidated mean square error and determine which method is achieveng the better results.
In this paper you should also include theoretical considerations, examples of Python coding and plots. 
The final results should be clearly stated.
