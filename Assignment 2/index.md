# Comparison of Locally Weighted Regression and Random Forest


Create a new Github page with a presentation on the concepts of Locally Weighted Regression and Random Forest. 
Apply the regression methods to real data sets, such as "Cars" or "Boston Housing Data" where you consider only one input variable (the weight of the car for the "Cars" data set and the number of rooms for the "Boston Hausing" data). The output varable is the mileage for the "Cars" data set and "cmedv" or the median price for the housing data.
For each method and data set report the crossvalidated mean square error and determine which method is achieveng the better results.
In this paper you should also include theoretical considerations, examples of Python coding and plots. 
The final results should be clearly stated.
